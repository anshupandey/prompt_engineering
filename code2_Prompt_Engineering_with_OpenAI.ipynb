        "**Description:** CoT prompting involves explicitly asking the model to show its reasoning steps or thought process before arriving at the final answer. This is often achieved by including phrases like \"Let's think step by step\" in the prompt. CoT can be used in a zero-shot or few-shot setting (Zero-shot CoT or Few-shot CoT).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Application Areas:** Complex reasoning tasks such as arithmetic, logical deduction, multi-step problem-solving, and question answering that requires synthesis of information.\n",
        "\n",
        "**When to Use:**\n",
        "- When the task requires multi-step reasoning.\n",
        "- When the final answer depends on intermediate steps.\n",
        "- To improve the accuracy on complex problems by guiding the model through the solution process.\n",

Each thought is generated or solved independently and passed to the next step, allowing the model to self-evaluate and decide whether to continue with that path or choose another.\n",

        "## Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) Prompting\n",
        "\n",
        "**Description:** Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) is a prompting technique designed to improve the factual accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) by explicitly prompting the model to generate a draft response, then generate verification questions for its own response, answer those questions independently of the initial draft, and finally use the answers to revise and improve the original draft. This creates a self-correction mechanism.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Application Areas:** Tasks requiring high factual accuracy and reduced hallucination, such as question answering, summarization of factual information, and generating reports or summaries based on provided text. It is particularly useful when dealing with complex or potentially ambiguous information where the model might otherwise confidently generate incorrect details.\n",
        "\n",
        "**When to Use:**\n",
        "- When factual accuracy is critical and errors could be harmful or misleading.\n",
        "- To reduce hallucinations and improve the reliability of the model's output.\n",
        "- When verifying information against external sources is not immediately feasible or desired within the prompting process itself.\n",
        "- For generating summaries or answers that require synthesizing information from multiple potential points within the model's knowledge or context.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it Works:**\n",
        "1. **Generate Initial Draft:** The model first generates a direct answer or response to the original prompt.\n",
        "2. **Generate Verification Questions:** The model is then prompted to generate questions that would help verify the correctness of the statements made in the initial draft.\n",
        "3. **Answer Verification Questions:** The model answers these verification questions *independently* of the initial draft, drawing from its internal knowledge or provided context. This step is crucial as it prevents the model from simply confirming its own potential errors.\n",
        "4. **Revise Initial Draft:** The model compares the answers to the verification questions with the original draft and revises the draft to align with the verified information.\n",
        "\n",
        "This iterative process helps the model identify inconsistencies or inaccuracies in its initial output and correct them before presenting the final response.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example (Conceptual):**\n",
        "\n",
        "Prompt: \"Explain the process of photosynthesis and its main outputs.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Initial Draft (Internal):** \"Photosynthesis is how plants make food. They use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. The main output is oxygen and sugar.\" (Might contain slight inaccuracies or missing details).\n",
        "2.  **Generate Verification Questions (Internal):**\n",
        "    *   \"What are the inputs of photosynthesis?\"\n",
        "    *   \"What are the outputs of photosynthesis?\"\n",
        "    *   \"What is the role of chlorophyll?\"\n",
        "    *   \"Where does photosynthesis primarily occur in a plant?\"\n",
        "3.  **Answer Verification Questions (Internal, independently):**\n",
        "    *   \"Inputs are carbon dioxide, water, and light energy.\"\n",
        "    *   \"Outputs are glucose (a sugar) and oxygen.\"\n",
        "    *   \"Chlorophyll is a pigment that absorbs light energy.\"\n",
        "    *   \"It occurs mainly in chloroplasts within plant cells.\"\n",
        "4.  **Revise Initial Draft (Internal, based on verified answers):** \"Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll. During photosynthesis, plants take in carbon dioxide from the air, water from the soil, and light energy from the sun. Using the energy absorbed by chlorophyll in their chloroplasts, they convert these inputs into glucose, a sugar they use for energy and growth, and oxygen, which is released as a byproduct.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The final output presented to the user would be the revised draft. While the user doesn't see the intermediate steps, the process happens internally within the model's processing based on the CoVe prompt structure.\n"

        "## ReAct Prompting\n",
        "**Description:** ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) prompting is a technique that combines reasoning trace generation with task-specific actions. It encourages the model to interleave thinking steps (Reasoning) with taking actions (Acting) through tools or interacting with an environment. The model observes the outcomes of its actions and uses this information to refine its subsequent reasoning and actions. This allows the model to perform tasks that require interacting with external sources of information or performing physical (or simulated physical) actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Application Areas:** Tasks that require external knowledge lookup, interacting with APIs or tools, complex decision-making, and environments where actions have observable consequences. Examples include answering questions that require searching the web, using a calculator for complex math, interacting with a simulated game environment, or completing tasks that involve multiple external steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "**When to Use:**\n",
        "- When the task requires up-to-date information not present in the model's training data.\n",
        "- When the task involves complex calculations or operations that the model is not inherently good at performing reliably.\n",
        "- When the task requires interacting with external systems or data sources.\n",
        "- To enable the model to break down a complex task into smaller, executable steps based on external feedback.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it Works (Simulated in a Prompt):** In a prompt, ReAct is simulated by guiding the model to explicitly state its \"Thought\" process (reasoning about the next step or action) and its \"Action\" (the action it would take or the tool it would use), followed by an \"Observation\" (the simulated result of the action). The model then uses the Observation to inform its next Thought and Action.\n"
