Many experts argue that AI will ultimately create more jobs than it eliminates, though the transition may be challenging.\",\n",

Rising global temperatures have led to more frequent extreme weather events including hurricanes, floods, and wildfires.

The project cost nearly $3 billion but has enabled countless medical advances and spawned new fields like pharmacogenomics.
